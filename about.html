        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi and welcome to my website. My name is Anna and in the last few years I discovered my passion for sewing, crocheting and making all kinds of things by myself.</p>
        <p>My journey started when I got my dog, Ivaldi. As he is a greyhound and they get easily cold in the winter, I needed some cosy clothing for him for the Berlin winter weather. I purchased amazing jumpers for him in Etsy, but soon realised they could get pretty pricy and I always wondered if I would be able to create some myself.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later my mom told me she get an extra sewing machine because my grandma was not able to use it anymore, so this was the perfect opportunely for me to start my sewing journey.</p>
        <p>After teaching myself how to sew, I also started crochet projects. Soon I also realised this is something I also love to do (especially in those cold winter months).</p>
        <p>Now a few years after I started, I realised I wanted to do more, so I will start with selling dog winter clothing and hats/beanies.</p>
        <p>BUT</p>
        <p>I have many ideas for other great sewing items I can potentially sell, so more will follow soon!</p>
